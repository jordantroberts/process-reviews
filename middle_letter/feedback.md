# Feedback from Kiah Hewitt from the Process Review:

## Did well
* Took time to read and understand the problem/challenge.
* Wrote the test first using TDD process
* Used rubber ducking to talk through the problems which seemed to help you gain clarity.
* Went back to planning when blocked to get visibility - good because it meant you didn't over think plan beforehand.
* Used test failures to decide next steps.
* Used Google to research before implementing whole method and to fill in gaps in your knowledge.
* Used rubber ducking to understand online resources too.
* Continuous process of planning --> writing --> testing instead of rushing ahead. This helped you to avoid a rabbit hole.
* You made one test pass and then feature tested in irb to gain full visibility before moving on to do the next step.
* Really good and effective TDD process which you followed consistently.
* Even refactored! 

## To improve
* Listed out the steps first, breaking down the challenge in pseudocode.
* Red/green/refactor - write one test first, solve that and then write the next (you wrote tests for both even and odd before writing the code).
* Don't put yourself down. At one point you said you were being stupid when actually you were using a logical approach and progressing steadily.
* Although you did feature test, might have been helpful to do this at the start?
